# 🏡 Home Assistant Blueprints

Welcome to the Home Assistant Blueprints repository! This repository contains a collection of useful and community-driven blueprints for Home Assistant, designed to simplify the automation of your smart home.

## What are Home Assistant Blueprints?

Blueprints are a way to share and reuse automations, scripts, and other configurations in Home Assistant. They allow you to import pre-configured setups and easily adapt them to your specific needs without writing complex YAML code from scratch.

## 🚀 Usage

To use a blueprint from this repository:

1.  Navigate to **Settings** -> **Automations & Scenes** -> **Blueprints** in your Home Assistant UI.
2.  Click on the **"Import Blueprint"** button.
3.  Enter the URL of the blueprint you wish to import. To get the correct URL, navigate to the blueprint file on GitHub, click the "Raw" button, and copy the URL from your browser's address bar. For example: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r3mcos3/blueprints/main/presence_lights/presence_lights.yaml`.
4.  Follow the on-screen prompts to configure the blueprint with your entities and settings.

For more detailed instructions, please refer to the official Home Assistant documentation on [Blueprints](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/blueprint/).
