## 🎯 How It Works

The blueprint uses a **priority-based mode selection** to determine the optimal heating strategy:

### Mode Priority (Highest to Lowest)

1. **❄️ Frost Protection** - When indoor temperature falls below frost protection threshold
   - Sets heating to minimum safe temperature
   - Highest priority to prevent damage

2. **🌡️ Eco Mode** - When outdoor temperature exceeds threshold
   - Turns heating off completely
   - Saves energy when it's warm outside

3. **🚪 Door/Window Open** - When doors/windows are open too long
   - Reduces to frost protection temperature
   - Prevents energy waste

4. **🏃 Away Mode** - When nobody is home
   - Sets to energy-saving away temperature
   - Comfort not needed when house is empty

5. **🌙 Night Mode** - During sleeping hours (when enabled)
   - Reduces to night temperature
   - Saves energy while maintaining comfort

6. **⏰ Pre-Heat Mode** - Before wake-up time (when enabled)
   - Increases to comfort temperature early
   - Ensures warmth when you wake up

7. **🏠 Comfort Mode** - Default when home
   - Maintains comfortable temperature
   - Applied when no other conditions are met

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Basic Setup

Minimal configuration for getting started:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Smart Heating - Living Room"
    use_blueprint:
      path: r3mcos3/smart_heating
      input:
        climate_entity: climate.living_room_thermostat
        indoor_temp_sensor: sensor.living_room_temperature
        outdoor_temp_sensor: sensor.outdoor_temperature
        presence_zone: zone.home
        door_window_sensors:
          - binary_sensor.front_door
          - binary_sensor.back_door
          - binary_sensor.living_room_window
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Comfort temperature (21°C) when home
- Away temperature (17°C) when away
- Night temperature (18°C) during 23:00-07:00
- Heating pauses if doors/windows open >2 minutes
- Pre-heating starts 30 minutes before 07:00

### Example 2: Advanced Configuration

With humidity compensation:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Smart Heating - Advanced"
    use_blueprint:
      path: r3mcos3/smart_heating
      input:
        climate_entity: climate.main_thermostat
        indoor_temp_sensor: sensor.indoor_temp
        outdoor_temp_sensor: sensor.weather_temperature
        presence_zone: zone.home
        door_window_sensors:
          - binary_sensor.front_door
          - binary_sensor.back_door
        comfort_temp: 22
        away_temp: 16
        night_temp: 19
        outdoor_temp_threshold: 16
        use_humidity: true
        humidity_sensor: sensor.indoor_humidity
        preheat_minutes: 45
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Custom temperatures (22°C comfort, 16°C away, 19°C night)
- Eco mode when outdoor >16°C
- Temperature adjusts ±0.5°C based on humidity
- Pre-heating starts 45 minutes early (06:15)

### Example 3: Energy Saving Focus

Optimized for maximum energy savings:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Smart Heating - Energy Saver"
    use_blueprint:
      path: r3mcos3/smart_heating
      input:
        climate_entity: climate.heating
        indoor_temp_sensor: sensor.temperature
        outdoor_temp_sensor: sensor.outdoor_temp
        presence_zone: zone.home
        door_window_sensors:
          - binary_sensor.all_doors
        comfort_temp: 20
        away_temp: 15
        night_temp: 17
        outdoor_temp_threshold: 15
        use_night_mode: true
        night_start: "22:00:00"
        night_end: "08:00:00"
        use_preheat: false
        door_open_delay: 60
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Lower comfort temperature (20°C)
- Aggressive away mode (15°C)
- Extended night mode (22:00-08:00)
- No pre-heating (saves energy)
- Quick door detection (1 minute)
- Lower outdoor threshold (15°C)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Heating Not Switching Modes

1. Check automation is enabled in Home Assistant
2. Verify all required entities exist and are working
3. Check automation traces: Settings → Automations → Smart Heating → Traces
4. Ensure presence zone is correctly reporting occupancy count
5. Check if outdoor temperature is above threshold (causing eco mode)

### Door/Window Detection Not Working

1. Verify binary sensors are in correct state (`on` = open, `off` = closed)
2. Check sensor device_class is set to `door`, `window`, or `opening`
3. Ensure door_open_delay matches your needs (default 120 seconds)
4. Test by opening a door/window and waiting for the configured delay
5. Check automation traces to see if triggers are firing

### Night Mode Not Activating

1. Verify "Enable Night Mode" is turned on in settings
2. Check night start/end times are configured correctly
3. Ensure someone is home (night mode requires presence)
4. For times spanning midnight, the blueprint handles wraparound automatically
5. Check automation traces around the configured night start time

### Pre-Heating Not Working

1. Verify both "Enable Night Mode" and "Enable Pre-heating" are on
2. Check pre-heat duration setting (default 30 minutes)
3. Ensure you're home during pre-heat time (requires presence)
4. Pre-heating triggers on periodic checks (every 15 minutes)
5. Verify indoor temperature is below comfort temperature

### Temperature Not Adjusting

1. Check climate entity is responding to commands
2. Test manually setting temperature via Developer Tools
3. Verify temperature sensors are providing valid readings
4. Check humidity sensor (if enabled) is returning valid values
5. Review Home Assistant logs for climate entity errors

### Eco Mode Always Active

1. Check outdoor temperature sensor reading
2. Verify outdoor_temp_threshold setting isn't too low
3. Ensure outdoor sensor is measuring actual outdoor temperature
4. Test by temporarily increasing outdoor threshold
5. Check if sensor is reporting correct units (°C)

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I use this with multiple climate entities?**
A: Create separate automations for each climate entity. Each automation can have different settings optimized for that room.

**Q: What happens if I manually change the temperature?**
A: The automation will override manual changes on the next trigger (arrival home, mode change, or periodic check). To temporarily override, disable the automation.

**Q: Does this work with non-Celsius temperatures?**
A: The blueprint is designed for Celsius. For Fahrenheit, adjust all temperature values accordingly.

**Q: Can I have different temperatures for weekdays vs weekends?**
A: Not directly, but you can create two automations with different schedules and use conditions to enable them based on day of week.

**Q: Why does heating turn off when it's warm outside?**
A: This is the eco mode feature. When outdoor temperature exceeds the threshold (default 18°C), heating is disabled to save energy. Adjust the "Outdoor Temperature Threshold" if needed.

**Q: How does humidity compensation work?**
A: High humidity (>70%) makes it feel warmer, so temperature is reduced by 0.5°C. Low humidity (<30%) makes it feel colder, so temperature is increased by 0.5°C.

**Q: What's the difference between away mode and eco mode?**
A: Away mode activates when nobody is home (sets to away temperature). Eco mode activates when outdoor temperature is high enough (turns heating off completely).
