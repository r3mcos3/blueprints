## 💡 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Monitor All Updates

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "All Update Notifications"
    use_blueprint:
      path: r3mcos3/update_notifications
      input:
        update_entities:
          - update.home_assistant_core_update
          - update.home_assistant_operating_system_update
          - update.home_assistant_supervisor_update
        mobile_app_device:
          - <your_android_device_id>
        reminder_hours: "6"
```

### Example 2: Core Updates Only with Config Check

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Core Update Notifications"
    use_blueprint:
      path: r3mcos3/update_notifications
      input:
        update_entities:
          - update.home_assistant_core_update
        mobile_app_device:
          - <your_android_device_id>
        run_config_check: true
        take_backup: true
```

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Addon Updates with Custom Changelogs"
    use_blueprint:
      path: r3mcos3/update_notifications
      input:
        update_entities:
          - update.my_custom_addon
        mobile_app_device:
          - <your_android_device_id>
        changelog_urls:
          update.my_custom_addon: "https://github.com/user/addon/releases"
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Notifications Not Sending

1. Verify the Companion App is connected and working on your Android device
2. Check that you've selected the correct device in the blueprint
3. Ensure the time is within your configured notification window
4. Check Home Assistant logs for errors

### Buttons Not Working

1. Check the debug logs at `blueprints.update_notifications` for callback data
2. Verify that `mobile_app_notification_action` events are being received in Developer Tools → Events
3. Ensure the correct Android device is selected in the blueprint
4. Ensure the automation is enabled and not paused
5. Look for "Install callback received" or "Skip callback received" messages in logs

**Debug log example:**
```
Install callback received - Action: install_update, Raw tag: reminder_home_assistant_operating_system_update, Clean Entity: update.home_assistant_operating_system_update
```

### Reminders Not Triggering

1. Verify reminder interval is not set to "Disabled"
2. Check that the current time is within your notification window
3. Ensure there are actually pending updates (state = "on")
4. For short intervals (5min), wait for the next matching minute

### Config Check Not Running

1. Ensure you've enabled "Run Config Check" in advanced settings
2. Verify the core update entity is included in your monitored entities
3. Make sure the Check Configuration addon is installed

### Changelog Button Not Appearing

1. The changelog button only appears when a `release_url` is available on the update entity
2. You can provide custom URLs via the "Custom Changelog URLs" setting in Advanced Settings
3. Some addons don't have changelog URLs available
